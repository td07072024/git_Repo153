The black-tailed godwit was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae under the binomial name Scolopax limosa.[3] It is now placed with three other godwits in the genus Limosa that was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760.[4][5] The name Limosa is from Latin and means "muddy", from limus, "mud".[6] The English name "godwit" was first recorded in about 1416–17 and is believed to imitate the bird's call.[7]

Four subspecies are recognised:[5]

L. l. islandica – Brehm, 1831: the Icelandic black-tailed godwit, which breeds mostly in Iceland, but also on the Faeroe Islands, the Shetland and the Lofoten Islands. It has a shorter bill, shorter legs and more rufous coloration extending onto the belly, compared to limosa.[8]
L. l. limosa – (Linnaeus, 1758): the European black-tailed godwit, which breeds from western and central Europe to central Asia and Asiatic Russia, as far east as the Yenisei River.[9] Its head, neck and chest are pale orange.[8]
L. l. melanuroides – Gould, 1846: the Asian black-tailed godwit, which breeds in Mongolia, northern China, Siberia and Far Eastern Russia.[9] Its plumage is similar to islandica, but the bird is distinctly smaller.[8]
L. l. bohaii – Zhu, Piersma, Verkuil & Conklin, 2020:[10] assumed to breed in Russian Far East; non-breeding in northeast China, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Peninsular Malaysia
